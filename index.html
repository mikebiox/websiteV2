        <h3 class="center-align"><strong>The Connected Crime Series</strong></h3>
        <h5 class="center-align hero_subtitle">A Series of Crime</h5> 
        <p>The <span class="text-bold">Connected Crime Series</span> takes place in the Brookway District. The district comprises twelve different cities, each having its own troubles. The district has multiple gangs and multiple mysteries. The story opens up in Kingston with <span class="text-bold">Criminal, PhD</span>. Doug, a tech guy, finds himself face-to-face with Shane, a cold-blooded killer. The story continues with <span class="text-bold">The List of 11</span> and a father seeking revenge. In <span class="text-bold">The Negotiator at Oak Lake</span>, Shane reappears but this time the gang is working in the quiet city of Oak Lake and Stanley, an ex-cop who worked as a hostage negotiator, finds himself in the middle of a gang war.</p> 

        <p>Doug’s story continues in <span class="text-bold">Criminal, PhD: the Captured Coder</span>. Doug wants to live a simple life. He wants to be as far away from trouble as possible. But danger still finds him when in broad daylight, he gets abducted. Detective Abbott (from <span class="text-bold">The List of 11</span>) is brought in to try and find Doug. And she isn’t the only one looking for him. </p> 

        <p>The latest novel is a one-off called <span class="text-bold">Boy in the Binoculars</span>. It still takes place in the Brookway district but it is an isolated story. Abraham, a retired detective, made a promise years ago to the parents of an abducted two-year-old. He’d find him and bring him home. But when Abraham thinks he sees the boy years later, he’ll do anything to confirm that this is the same missing boy even though the evidence says otherwise.</p> 

        <p><span class="text-bold">The Connected Crime Series</span> follows many different characters with some crossing over between novels. Explore a world of crime!</p>
